                        <h3>The card creator</h3>
                        <p>
                            The card creator consists of a central frame where the items for the card will be placed, a selector for the actual items, and buttons
                            for the categories of items.
                            <br/>
                            <pre>
                        The buttons will toggle the selector window content. The buttons are as follows:
                    Frame button, which will toggle in the selector frames and borders to surround the card.
                    Image button, which will toggle in the selector a multitude of photos to choose from and place in the central frame.
                    The first item of the image selector is a button to upload your own photos
                    Background button, which will toggle in the selector choices for the background
                    Text button which will change the selector into text options
                        The selector is a window controlled by the buttons, where items will be displayed in a column. To see all the items,
                    this window implements a scroll bar.
                        The central frame is where all the items go. These items can be selected and manipulated with the cursor. This will
                    be shown by a border around the selected object. When text is selected, the user will be able to type and modify it.
