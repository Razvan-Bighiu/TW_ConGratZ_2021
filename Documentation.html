        <h2>External Interface Requirements</h2>

            <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
            <section>
                <h3>The card creator</h3>
                <p>
                    The card creator consists of a central frame where the items for the card will be placed, a selector for the actual items, and buttons for the categories of items.
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        The buttons will toggle the selector window content. The buttons are as follows: 
                        <br/>
                        Frame button, which will toggle in the selector frames and borders to surround the card. 
                        <br/>
                        Image button, which will toggle in the selector a multitude of photos to choose from and place in the central frame. 
                        <br/>
                        The first item of the image selector is a button to upload your own photos Background button, which will toggle in the selector choices for the background. 
                        <br/>
                        Text button which will change the selector into text options 
                        <br/>
                        The selector is a window controlled by the buttons, where items will be displayed in a column. To see all the items, this window implements a scroll bar. 
                        <br/>The central frame is where all the items go. 
                        These items can be selected and manipulated with the cursor. This will be shown by a border around the selected object. When text is selected, the user will be able to type and modify it.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h3>The card viewer</h3>
                <p>
                    <p>
                        The main role of the Card Viewer was to display a greeting card and some features that I will describe in the System Features. There are 3 standard buttons on the CardViewer page like“LogIn”, “SignUp”, “NewCard” and functions like “Search”, “Share” and
                        “Download”. In the search section you can look up for a specific kind of greeting card in order to find what you need, also Download and Share become useful if you want to Download the greeting card and print it, or you can share
                        it with your friends, online.
