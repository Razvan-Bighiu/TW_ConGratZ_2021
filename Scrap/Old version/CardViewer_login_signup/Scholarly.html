				<h1>User interface</h1>
				<p>The main role of the Card Viewer was to display a greeting card and some features that I will describe in the System Features. There are 3 standard buttons on the CardViewer page like  “LogIn”, “SignUp”, “NewCard” and functions like “Search”, “Share” and “Download”.  In the search section you can look up for a specific kind of greeting card in order to find what you need, also Download and Share become useful if you want to Download the greeting card and print it, or you can share it with your friends, online.</p>
